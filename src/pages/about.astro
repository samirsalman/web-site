  <h2>🎓 Education</h2>
  <br>
  <!-- Master's Degree Section -->
  <div class="degree">
    <h4>📘 Master's Degree</h4>
	<p>I studied at the University of Rome "Tor Vergata" from 2019 to 2021, where I pursued a Master's Degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. My thesis was titled <strong>"Evaluation of Explainability of Machine Learning Models: ERO-MD Explainable Model for Migraine Diagnosis"</strong> and was supervised by Prof. Fabio Massimo Zanzotto. I graduated with honors, receiving a final grade of <strong>110 cum laude</strong> 🎉.</p>
	<p>My research focused on the development of an explainable machine learning model for migraine diagnosis 🧠💡. The model, named <strong>ERO-MD</strong>, was evaluated on a real-world dataset of migraine patients and demonstrated promising results in terms of accuracy and explainability. This work contributed to increasing transparency in AI-driven healthcare solutions.</p>

<h4>📗 Bachelor's Degree</h4>
<p>I completed my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at the University of Mac Lane and Knights from 2016 to 2019. During my undergraduate studies, I developed a keen interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning 🤖, which led me to pursue a career in this field. </p>
<p>My thesis focused on the <strong>automation of semantic annotations and the population of ontologies</strong>, specifically in the context of resolutions of the United Nations 🌍. I worked under the supervision of Prof. Armando Stellato and successfully defended my thesis, receiving positive feedback from the examination committee 🙌.</p>
